# 🎬 LazyYouTubeWatcher

**LazyYouTubeWatcher** is a playful yet practical system that prevents you from endlessly streaming YouTube videos when you fall asleep.

After a configurable time, it pauses your YouTube playback and sends you a Telegram notification.  
You must confirm you’re still awake (by pressing a button ✅/❌ in Telegram).  
Only then will playback continue.

## Features

- **Auto-pause YouTube** after a set time
- **Telegram notifications** with inline Yes/No buttons
- **Resume playback** if you confirm you’re awake
- **Pause playback** if you don’t confirm (or press No)
- Works with YouTube on **desktop Chrome** (via extension)
